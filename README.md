# EasyHealth
This project is all about integrating health system that includes doctor's prescription, buying medicine,
collecting diagonastic data from diagonastic center, insurence claim etc.
In Details : like a patient can book appointment online, doctor can prescribe medicine online that will be stored in database attached to patient health id.
And if doctor prescribes some medical test, patient can directly visite the diagonastic center as per avaibility, gets the test done and don't have to wait for report.
Diagonatic centers can directly upload data online which will be attached to patient health id. This will keep all health record of patient and will be helpful to doctors in treatment.
This is initial idea,and many more features can be impletmented as the project proceeds.
